## SNOWFALL

Unique, special and all mine
A snowfall at five in the morning
has few observers, let alone admirers

A moment to look up at the moon,
ponder the day 
and wonder about the not so distant future

The day ahead is long
but provides the pathway out
into the golden days when she might be here

As the snow crunches below my feet
crackling pop goes the ice
a wind howls through the trees

Calling my soul to attention
to be present
in life now and in every special moment
